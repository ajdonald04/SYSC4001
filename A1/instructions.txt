FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN CODE

RUNNING INTERRUPTS.CPP

1) Unzip and extract extrafiles folder 
2) bring the "functions.cpp" file into the same folder in which the interrupts.cpp and interrupts.hpp are located
3) open a termial 
4) cd into the folder where the functions.cpp, interrupts.cpp & interrupts.hpp files are.
5) run the following command: 
    g++ interrupts.cpp functions.cpp -o execution.o
6) After compiling, run the following command:
    ./execution.o
7) Input the Vector Table name
8) Input the Trace file name
9) Input the name of output file which will hold the simulation reports
10) The output of the simluation will be in the "inputed_file_name".txt


RUNNING TEST SCRIPT 1
1) Open terminal 
2) cd into the folder where the test1.cpp file is located *MAKE SURE FUNCTIONS.CPP IS IN THE SAME FOLDER
3) run the following command: 
    ./test1.sh
4) The output of the simulation will be in execution1.txt

RUNNING TEST SCRIPT 2
1) Open terminal 
2) cd into the folder where the test2.cpp file is located *MAKE SURE FUNCTIONS.CPP IS IN THE SAME FOLDER
3) run the following command: 
    ./test2.sh
4) The output of the simulation will be in execution2.txt
