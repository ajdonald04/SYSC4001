Basic Instructions for compile / executing the project 

1. Unzip folders additionalFiles.zip and otherTests.zip 
2. Copy files from both folders (additionalFiles and otherTests) into same directory as interrupts.cpp/hpp, these should include vector_table.txt and any test.sh files for the additional tests created.
3. To compile the program, in terminal enter the following command: 
g++ interrupts.cpp -I interrupts.hpp -o output.o 
./output.o 
Then follow the prompts to input your own .txt files such as new trace or vector table files (be sure these files are the in correct (same) directory)
4. To use the python script (calculate_overhead.py), copy it into the same directory as interrupts.cpp/hpp
5. To run testX.sh scripts, be sure to run them as executables.
